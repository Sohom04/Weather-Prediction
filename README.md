# Weather Prediction

This project predicts weather conditions using historical data provided in `weather_data.csv` and a Python script `weather_prediction.py`.

## Project Structure
- `weather_data.csv`: Contains historical weather data used for training and prediction.
- `weather_prediction.py`: Main Python script for data processing, model training, and prediction.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install required libraries (if any) as specified in the script.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python weather_prediction.py
   ```
4. The script will read data from `weather_data.csv` and output predictions.

## Features
- Reads and processes weather data.
- Trains a prediction model (details in the script).
- Outputs weather predictions based on input data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Additional Python libraries (see `weather_prediction.py` for details)
